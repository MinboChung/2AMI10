# <center>Foundations of Process Mining (2AMI10)</center>
## Objectives
- Good understanding of process mining
- Understand the role of data sciencein today's society
- Be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business ingelligence, data mining, ml, and verification
- Be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log
- Be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models
- Be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g. show bottlenecks)
- Good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project
- Be able to clean and reshape data to match the requirements for a process mining project

## Content
- Data science's importance in utilizing data for smart decision-making
- Process mining bridges traditional process analysis and data-centric techniques
- Process mining aligns event data with process models
- Applicable across various operational processes (e.g. healthcare, customer service, system analysis)
- Course covers process mining fundamentals:
    - Data pre-processing through visual inspection and filtering
    - Process discovery to obtain process models from event logs automatically.
    - Conformance checking to assess model quality using fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity
    - Enriching models with event log perspectives (performance, decisions, resources)
- Real-life event log examples used for practical understanding.
